The Dining philosophers is a synchronization problem which is used to evaluate situations where there is a need of allocating multiple resources to multiple processes. The problem is:

Consider there are **five philosophers** sitting around a circular dining table. The dining table has **five forks** and a bowl of food in the middle.
At any instant, a philosopher is either **eating** or **thinking**. When a philosopher wants to eat, he uses *two forks* - one from their left and one from their right. When a philosopher wants to think, he keeps down both forks at their original place.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of food;

## Solution
* The philosopher have a tuple of the neighbors forks
* The fork have a current **owner**
* A philosopher can only eat if he is owner of both neighbors forks
* When the philosopher wants to eat, he request the forks that he is not owner and waits until the others philosophers finish using it.
* When a philosopher finish eat, he change the state of the fork to **dirty**, and send a "signal" that he is finished eat.
